# Peripleo

React components for map-based search interfaces.

Peripleo is a React utility library that aims to simplify the development of map-based search and data visualization interfaces. Peripleo provides:

- an __architecture pattern__ and useful helpers to simplify application design
- a __library of React components__ useful when building map search interfaces

## Why not MapBox, MapLibre, etc.?

Peripleo is __not an alternative to existing map and geo-visualization libraries__ like [MapBox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gljs), [MapLibre](https://maplibre.org/) or [DeckGL](https://deck.gl/). It complements them by providing __additional utilities and UI components that work with MapBox, MapLibre and DeckGL__.

Think of Peripleo as an add-on toolbox that will help you keep your development work [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) when you build your next map application.
